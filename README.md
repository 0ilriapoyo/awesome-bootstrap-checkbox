## What is Visual TFT?
     
Visual TFT is a drag-and-drop development environment that allows you to create GUIs for devices with TFT displays and touch panels. You can use Visual TFT to design interfaces for embedded systems, multimedia devices, smart home appliances, industrial controllers, and more. Visual TFT supports a wide range of graphics controllers and display sizes, from 131x131 to 800x600 pixels. You can also use Visual TFT to create GUIs for devices that use the FTDI chip, which is a powerful platform that integrates display, audio, and touch functionality.
     
## What are the benefits of Visual TFT?
     
Visual TFT has many advantages over other GUI development tools. Some of the benefits are:

- It is easy to use. You can design your GUI by simply dragging and dropping components from the toolbox, such as buttons, labels, images, sliders, graphs, etc. You can also customize the properties of each component, such as color, font, size, position, etc.
- It is fast and efficient. You can switch from design to code with a single click, and generate the source code for your GUI in C or Pascal. You can also use Visual TFT with any of the Mikroe compilers, such as mikroC, mikroBasic, or mikroPascal.
- It is compatible with all Mikroe hardware. You can use Visual TFT with any of the Mikroe development or multimedia boards, which have the TFT display and touch panel integrated. You can also order separate TFT displays from Mikroe's online store.
- It is powerful and versatile. You can use Visual TFT to create GUIs for devices that use the FTDI chip, which supports many advanced features, such as sound, transparency, anti-aliasing fonts, video playback, etc. You can also use many new components that are natively supported by the FTDI chip, such as gauges, clocks, calendars, etc.
- It is affordable and reliable. You can buy Visual TFT for a one-time payment of $119.00, and get a lifetime license that includes free upgrades and technical support. You can also download a free trial version of Visual TFT and test it before buying.
